To any homies whom'st this may concern. (Rubik's company call me)

Currently what that ish looks like (3x3) -> ![3x3 Dimension Rubik's Cube picture](images/NormalCube.png)

But it can also look like (2x2) -> ![2x2 Dimension Rubik's Cube picture](/images/2x2Cube.png)

Or it can look like (200x200) woah! (my computer didn't like much more than that ):) -> ![200x200 Dimension Rubik's Cube picture! Woah!](/images/200x200Cube.png)

/*Intoduction*/
/*****************************************************************************************************************************
* Making an opengl viewing port for my rubik's cube simulation that I've made.
*
* Right now it's super not intuative at all because I just want to make sure I can get it to work before making it pretty.
*
* The view is you looking at the front face up, but (hopefully) I'll be able to make it into a 3d model where you can see
* all sides since the groundwork is basically there, I just need to get the 3d part to work.
******************************************************************************************************************************/

/*Controls*/
/*****************************************************************************************************************************
* It's pretty safe to say these controls are super arbitrary until I get something cool and neat set up for real, these
* aren't even really supposed to be used by people and will probably change a lot during devlopment. I might not even
* update the readme!
*
* All moves are made using the right-hand rule. If you are looking at the cube face on it works as if you will reach your
* right hand in on the piece and turn it clockwise (from the right or top), same with the top. If you were to turn a vertical
* piece clockwise it would be turned up, likewise, if you a horizontal pice clockwise it means to turn the horizontal piece to
* the left.
*
* How the movement system works right now (and later just internally) possible pieces to be turned on the cube will be numbered
* 0 through cubeSize * 2 - 1. where 0 through cubeSize - 1 are the vertical pieces going from left to right and pieces cubeSize
* through cubeSize * 2 - 1 are all horizontal pieces from top to bottom. This means that possible pieces to move will be 0
* through 5 on a normal 3x3 cube.
